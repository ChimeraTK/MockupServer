# Overview
Read variables of a ChimeraTK server and create a server that show exactly the same variables. It is not filling anything meaningful to the variables it is just showing them. This can be useful if the final ChimeraTK server is not working yet, but someone wants to prepare client applications using the ChimeraTK servers variables.

#Operation
Since the server needs to know all variables during start time it expects an input xml file called:
<pre> dummy_server_input.xml <pre>
